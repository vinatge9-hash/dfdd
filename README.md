Key design decisions

- Typography: Primary headings via Oswald, body text via Roboto, to convey bold yet readable styling.
- Layout: Clean, mobile-first grid system using Tailwind utility classes only.
- Accessibility: Alt text on all images, semantic HTML structure, clear focusable elements.

How to run
